# OrbitX
macOS interface for Orbit algorithm

* Currently only supports entering a direct message,
seeing the encrypted text and the key used to encrypt and vice-versa with decryption

* Still working on trying to figure out file manipulation with files outside of a bundle. Interface is able to browse for a file and store the file location, but I don't know how to read/write external files.
